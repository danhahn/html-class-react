# Homework

* [Box Model]()
* [Pseudo Class](pseudo.html)
* [Floats](floats.html)
* [Clear Fix](clear-fix.html)
* [Homework](homework.html)

[Download Stater File](homework6_yourname.zip)

The point of this homework is to work with floats and the box model to create example of what a homepage of a site might look like.

## Getting started

Download the starer file and be sure to rename both the folder and file name.

In this folder you will find

* 1 html page
* 1 css file
* 1 folder of images

## global nav

For the global nav we need to turn a vertical nav in to a horizontal nav.

## promos

In this section we need to "stack" the promo boxes next to each other.  Here there is a small 10px gap between each box.  

Here you will need to put a margin right on all but the last box.  Keep in mind that we can use `:last-child` to target the last element.

**Note:** you may need to define a width to get the boxes to align correct.

## more content

Here we need to use the box model get the correct size of each box.  

So lets figure out the size for each box in this section.  

* total width 1000px
* 4 boxes
* 10px of space between each box (not after the last)
* 10px of padding on each box
* 1px border

<div class="homework-view" data-lesson="lesson6"></div>
